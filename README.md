# Bang

Do you work in a company where you should create projects following some patterns? or do you like to create projects to practice or for open source following some structure?

So this project is for you! using just a config file and some snippets of code, you gonna be able to generate new projects with a well-defined pattern.

> If you are wondering why the name of this project is bang this is because, my first idea to name that was **big bang** but I don't like to write so change just to bang.

This project is guided by these main principles:
  - **Easy to use.** the CLI should have a clear interface, and the config file should be self-explanatory.
  - **External templates.** all templates should be created in the external resource as a local folder in your machine or a repository on Github. 
  - **Agnostic of programming language.** the bang command should allow project creation for any kind of programming language.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install bang.

```bash
pip install bang
```

## Usage

```sh
bang my-project -l my-template
```
